# AgriRec-Decision-Tree-Based-Agricultural-Crop-Recommendation-with-Web-Platform-Integration

In the pursuit of sustainable and enhanced 
agriculture, with growing food demands and environmental 
challenges, precision agriculture has become a pivotal 
innovation to optimize crop production. This research presents 
AgriRec, an AI-powered web platform designed to deliver 
precise crop cultivation using machine learning. The following 
study is based on the Crop Recommendation dataset, which 
comprises 2,200 records with eight agronomic factors consisting 
of the soil nutrients and environmental factors such as Nitrogen 
(N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) along with pH of soil, 
temperature, humidity and rainfall. The dataset also has a label 
column, providing the different crop types. This study uses data 
preprocessing techniques like filling missing values and 
removing duplicates to ensure consistency. Different machine 
learning models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K
Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree and Logistic 
Regression, are utilized and evaluated using performance 
metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision and F1-Score. Among 
these four, Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy of 
98.18%. Thus, the optimal model, Decision Tree is deployed in a 
web-interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript facilitating 
user engagement to get real-time inputs and predictions. The 
following study showcases the considerable capability of 
machine learning in revolutionizing traditional farming 
practice, offering farmers with a practical tool to improve their 
crop yield and decision-making, promoting sustainable farming 
methods to mitigate food needs.
